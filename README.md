This was the final assignment for my Internet Programming course @ Kennesaw State University during the Fall 2018 Semester.

The goal of this assignment was to make a basic RESTful CRUD Django application which obtains data from a SQLite3 database and
displays the information in a single view on "/measurements", which is formatted into an HTML table.
